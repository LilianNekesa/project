In this analysis we are going to perform explaratory and predictive analysis. Through this data, we are also going to see which features contributes most to total production. For this prediction, we are going to use machine learning and deep learning to train our model and predict the outcome. This analysis contains visualizations done using plotly and a dashboard deployed in streamlit.
